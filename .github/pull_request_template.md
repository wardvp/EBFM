- [ ] I ran the [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/EBFMorg/EBFM?tab=readme-ov-file#developer-notes) and fixed all issues
- [ ] I added an entry under *develop* in the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/EBFMorg/EBFM/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) (may be skipped for minor changes not observable for the user)
