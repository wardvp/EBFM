# Contributing

This file collects information about contributing to the project.

## How to Contribute

If you plan to contribute a new feature or make a substantial change, please [open an issue](https://github.com/EBFMorg/EBFM/issues) first or comment on an existing one.

For small fixes (for example, typos or minor edits), you can directly [fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and [create a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

## Pre-Commit Hooks

Please make sure to [set up pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/EBFMorg/EBFM?tab=readme-ov-file#pre-commit). This ensures your code follows the correct formatting and includes proper copyright and license information. The project uses [REUSE](https://reuse.software/) for license tracking.

* If you have questions about picking the right license, don't hesitate to ask. You can also apply any license and we will review and discuss this in your pull request.
* If checks fail and you’re unsure how to fix them, you can temporarily bypass with `--no-verify`. We’ll help you resolve the issues in your pull request.

## Attribution

As a contributor, you’re welcome to add your name and contact information to the [list of authors](https://github.com/EBFMorg/EBFM/blob/main/AUTHORS.txt) if you wish. Your GitHub username will automatically appear in the [commit history](https://github.com/EBFMorg/EBFM/commits/main/) once your contribution is merged.
